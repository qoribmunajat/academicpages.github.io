Description
======
This course teaches basic techniques for abstracting data, creating algorithms that can access the data, and manipulating the abstract structure. This course also covers analysis of the complexity of space and time in implementing an algorithm. The topics covered include: concept of abstract data type, linear data model (array and dynamic list, stack and queue), set, hierarchical data model (binary tree, heap, binary search tree, AVL-tree, B-tree) model graph, hashtable, tracking algorithm
