Description
======
This course teaches linear programming (LP) modeling, its related methodology/algorithms and linear programming problems as well as its variants. In the end of lecture, students are expected to be able to use techniques in Operation Research such as linear programming and network optimization to solve problems in various domain problems (including manufacturing, transportation, construction, telecommunication), obtain optimal solutions of mathematical programming problems, and present managerial recommendations based on optimal solutions and sensitivity analysis.
