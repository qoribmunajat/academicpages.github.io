abstract: 'Inter-organizational IT/IS implementation must deal not only with the technical complexities across different systems, but also the alignment between strategies and expected functionalities between the involved institutions. This paper aims to uncover the aspirational requirements in the implementation of integrated criminal justice systems (ICJS) in Indonesia. It involved four main agencies: police, prosecutor office, court, and prison, as well as some auxiliary agencies. The research is contrasting the aspiration-based design with rational alignment needs as defined in the classic Strategic Alignment Model.
