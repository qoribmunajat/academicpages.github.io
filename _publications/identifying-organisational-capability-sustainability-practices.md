abstract: 'The growing awareness of the importance of sustainability motivates companies to engage in sustainability practices. However, practising sustainability is challenging since most initiatives are inter-organisational in nature.  The implementation depends heavily on the capability of multiple organisations within the supply chain, which are not easily assessed. Although a few scholars have proposed a number of frameworks to help organisations identify the required organisational capabilities, none of them is comprehensive enough due to the limited scope. In order to develop a more comprehensive sustainability framework, a complete understanding of organisational capabilities needed for sustainability practices is necessary. This research-in-progress paper therefore aims to synthesize the required key capabilities based on widely im-plemented sustainability guidelines/standards. The identification of key capabilities is important to understand and explore how ICT can be used by organisations to develop the required sus-tainability capabilities. This study will potentially contribute to the development of a holistic sus-tainability framework.'
