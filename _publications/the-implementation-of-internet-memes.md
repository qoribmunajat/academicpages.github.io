abstract: 'This study aims to assess the potential of memes to be used in advertising to improve the brand awareness of an Indonesian e-commerce business, Fabelio. The method used in this study is experimental - quantitative. The experiment was conducted using Instagram posts. To answer the research question, this study measured the memes virality and the brand awareness of the respondent. There are two respondent groups involved in this experiment which are respondents who follow Fabelio’s Instagram account (control group) and respondents who like the memes but do not follow Fabelio’s Instagram post (experimental group). The brand awareness level for both groups were compared using t-test. The result of this study shows that the brand awareness level of the experimental group is similar with the control group which shows that memes is as effective as traditional ads in improving the brand awareness. In addition, the type of meme that has the highest virality level is silliness and sarcasm type. This finding could be used as consideration for business to implement memes as form of ads.'
