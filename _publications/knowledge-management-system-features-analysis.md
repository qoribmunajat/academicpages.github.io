abstract: 'One of indicators used to measure the work performance in the Office of Research, Development and Training (Balitbangdiklat) in the Ministry of Religious Affairs in Indonesia is the utilization of research results as the policy-making basis by a technical working-unit in the ministry. In fact, until the late 2014, the utilization of research results had not met the target. The non-existence of knowledge sharing system for researchers is predicted to be one of the factors that cause the low quality of the research, which in turn leads to the under-using of the research results. This study aims to analyze the knowledge management system model and design its prototype. This study uses soft system methodology approach combined with supporting theories such as Burnett&#39;s knowledge audit and the theory of culture organization by Cameron&Quinn. This research resulted in 11 activities in the conceptual model, six functional features, and a non-technical mechanism design for the organization in implementing the knowledge management system.'
